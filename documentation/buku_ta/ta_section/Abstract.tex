In order to make the benefits could still be felt, the content accessed is directed to the field of education, one of which is the development of human civilization which is still considered boring to study\cite{wirawan_2018}. The museum as a means of learning is actually not worth visiting, where 435 of the recorded museums are in poor condition according to the Directorate for the Preservation of Culture and Museum of the Ministry of Education and Culture\cite{kemendikbud_2019}. Therefore, an interactive holographic projection system was created to convey information effectively and interactively so that it was interesting to learn. The method used is the museum object displayed in the form of a hologram and can be moved and interacted by the user using the Leap Motion hand sensing sensor. The test results show that hand gestures can provide an appropriate response of 90.71\%, with 72.00\% successfully activated using one hand and 97.50\% using both hands. This is supported by direct experiments by respondents with success rate of 87.00\%. Based on a questionnaire of 61 respondents, 47.50\% of respondents strongly agreed that this system could help the learning of the development of human civilization and 68.9\% agreed strongly that this system could support the development of museums and education in Indonesia.}
